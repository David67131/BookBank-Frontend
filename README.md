## Project description  
BookBank is a web application that allows users to browse and purchase books. The application will have two main entities: books and customers. Customers will be able to create an account, browse books, add them to a cart, and complete the purchase.

## Tech Stack: We propose using the MERN stack, which includes:
1, MongoDB: for the database  
2, Express.js: for the backend server  
3, React: for the front-end UI  
4, Node.js: for the runtime environment  
### Frontend:  
1, React  
2, CSS  
3, Bootstrap  
### Backend:  
1, MongoDB  
2, Express.js  
3, Node.js  

## RestAPI doing CRUD operations on at least THREE entities (Data Model):
### 1, Book entity:  
(1) title  
(2) author  
(3) genre  
(4) price  
(5) rating  
(6) description  

### 2, Customer entity:
(1) name  
(2)	email

(5)	payment information  

### 3, Order entity:

## Create a Git Project which may contain a couple of repositories (front and back) of your project. We will create two repositories:
1, BookBank-Frontend: contains the front-end code  
2, BookBank-Backend: contains the back-end code
